# QR Code scanning apps


Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].
In most cases you should not need an app at all. First try open the camera app on your phone and point it at the QR code.  If your camera recognises the QR code you should be prompted to ‘open evacheckin.com’ in your browser. 

**Apple**: See the instructions [here](https://www.google.com) for Apple.  We also have an iPhone app which is good for group check-ins

**Android**: Using your camera should work for Android phones with version 8 up too. 

In some cases there is a camera setting that needs to be turned on – so check your settings. See here for more instructions specific to your model.  

For older Android phones a we recommend our Android app.

You will need to have mobile data turned on or access to WiFi for the page to load.  

Need links to the apps to share with your team/guests?

Apple App -  evacheck.in/apple 
Android App - evacheck.in/android

The apps work well for group check-in scenarios - like a family checking in at a sports club
